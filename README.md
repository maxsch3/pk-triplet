- loss functions:
    - batch semi hard loss from google's paper [FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) 
    - batch hard loss from paper [In Defense of the Triplet Loss for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07737)
    - batch pre-train loss a loss functions to be used to prime a newly inititalized model
